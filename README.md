## Project Information

Fluffy Twins is based a game principle of MemoryÂ® by Ravensburger. It is my first learning project I created from ground up using my basic knowledge in React. It is also a UX experiment. I use robohash.org to create unique individual cat faces for the cards each time a new game board is generated. I also tried to integrate GSAP for some animation effects.

The project still lacks a lot of React design patterns, how things should be done "right". I am sure I will revisit it at a later learning stage.
